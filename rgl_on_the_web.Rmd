## Introduction

- `rgl` is a package that allows you to create dynamic 3D graphics
in R.
```{r echo=FALSE, results='hide'}

```
```{r setupearth, echo=FALSE}

long <- matrix(seq(-180, 180, len=50)*pi/180, 50, 50)
r <- 6378.1 # radius of Earth in km
x <- r*cos(lat)*cos(long); y <- r*cos(lat)*sin(long)
z <- r*sin(lat)

```

- I'll be giving a talk tomorrow (Sidney Smith Hall, Room 1087, 3:30 PM) that gives history and 
background on `rgl`.  Today I want to concentrate on practical
aspects:  How do you create plots?  How do you put them on the web?

## Following along

- This presentation is written in RMarkdown, and is available at
http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/talks/2015-12-02.
- `rgl_on_the_web.Rmd` is the source; we are looking at `rgl_on_the_web.html`.  
- Producing the HTML file requires R, but viewing it doesn't.  
All the graphics is being done in Javascript by the browser.
Your phone or tablet can probably display it.
- I'm using version `r packageVersion("rgl")` of `rgl` and version `r packageVersion("rglwidget")` of `rglwidget`, both
from R-Forge.  Earlier versions of both packages are on CRAN.

## The mental model

 - In R, base graphics are designed as "drawing in ink on paper".
 - `grid` graphics (used in `ggplot2` and `lattice`) form a hierarchy
of viewports and objects within them that can be modified as you go.
 - `rgl` is more like `grid`, but can be used like base graphics.
 - In WebGL, the primitive objects are points, line segments and
 triangles.  WebGL and the graphics hardware handle the work of
 displaying them in 3D.
 - `rgl` has a few other types made up of the primitive objects (e.g.
 surfaces made up of meshes of polygons), or for modifying their
 appearance (e.g. lights, projections).
 
# Creating objects

## Plotting primitives

- The functions `points3d()`, `lines3d()`, `segments3d()`, `triangles3d()`, `quads3d()` draw primitives, e.g.
```{r echo=3:4}
rgl.close()
set.seed(87)
x <- rnorm(6); y <- rnorm(6); z <- rnorm(6)
triangles3d(x, y, z, col = c(2,2,2,3,4,5))
rglwidget()
```

- Colours (and other properties) are set per vertex and interpolated
between.

## Derived objects

- The functions `texts3d()`, `spheres3d()` and `planes3d()` act like primitives:
```{r echo=2:4}
rgl.close()
texts3d(x, y, z, texts=1:6)
spheres3d(x + 8, y, z, radius=(1:6)/5, col = rainbow(6))
planes3d(0, 1, 1, 0, col = "white") # y + z = 0
par3d(zoom = 0.5)
rglwidget()
```

- They are actually constructed out of triangles.

## Meshes

Several functions produce and work with "meshes":  R objects
containing vertices and indexes defining faces.

- `cube3d()`,  `tetrahedron3d()`, etc. 
- `cylinder3d()`, `extrude3d()`, `turn3d()`, `polygon3d()`
- `subdivision3d()`, `addNormals()`
```{r results="hide",webgl=TRUE, echo=2, fig.height=2}
rgl.close()
example(cylinder3d)
par3d(zoom=0.8)
```

## High level functions

- High level functions in `rgl` are modelled on base graphics:
`plot3d()`, `persp3d()`.
- There are also a number of functions to add decorations to the plots:  `axis3d()`, `axes3d()`, `bbox3d()`, `bgplot3d`, `box3d()`,
`decorate3d()`, `grid3d()`, `mtext3d()`
```{r echo=2:3}
rgl.close()
xyz <- matrix(rnorm(300), ncol = 3)
plot3d(xyz, main = "Random Normals", type = "s", col = rainbow(100))
par3d(zoom=0.8)
rglwidget()
```

## persp3d() is better than persp()

- In base graphics, `persp(x, y, z)` requires `x` and `y` to be 
vectors, and `z` to be a matrix.  It is plotted as though `z = f(x,y)`.
- In `rgl`, any of the three arguments can be matrices.  A parametric
surface `(x(s,t), y(s,t), z(s,t))` can be plotted:
```{r cylinder,echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
z <- matrix(seq(0, 1, len=50), 50, 50)
theta <- t(z)
r <- 1 + exp( -pmin( (z - theta)^2, 
		     (z - theta - 1)^2, 
		     (z - theta + 1)^2 )/0.01 )
x <- r*cos(theta*2*pi)
y <- r*sin(theta*2*pi)

persp3d(x, y, z, col="red")
```

## persp3d() output

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
rglwidget()
```

# Some details

## Specifying coordinates

- `rgl` uses R's `xyz.coords()` function to interpret the `x`, `y` and
`z` arguments.  
- This makes it quite flexible:  `x` can be a
matrix or list, allowing `y` and `z` to be skipped, etc.
```{r echo=2}
rgl.close()
spheres3d(xyz, col=rainbow(100), radius = 0.3)
par3d(zoom=0.7)
rglwidget()
```

## Object IDs

- Functions that create objects return numerical IDs.  
- Use these to remove or hide objects (more below).
```{r echo=-1}
rgl.close()
print( plot3d(xyz, main = "Random Normals", type = "s") )
rgl.ids()
```


## Material properties

- Each vertex (or whole object) has a number of "material properties" that determine how
it is rendered.  Use `material3d()` to set or query defaults.
```{r}
names(material3d())
```

- Normals and texture coordinates are also vertex properties.

## Normals

- In geometry, the normal to a surface is a vector perpendicular to it. It determines how light is reflected.
- In `rgl`, normals can be set at each vertex independent of the geometry, and this can be used to fake curved surfaces.
- These are the same shape, but with different normals:
```{r echo=FALSE}
rgl.close()
surface1 <- subdivision3d(tetrahedron3d(), 3)
surface2 <- addNormals(surface1)
shade3d(surface1, col = "red")
shade3d(translate3d(surface2, 1,0,0), col = "blue")
par3d(zoom = 0.5)
rglwidget()
```

## Textures

- In computer graphics, "textures" are fixed bitmaps that are
displayed on a 3D surface.  For example,
<img src="`r system.file("textures/world.png",package="rgl")`" width="50%" align="middle" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"/>  
is displayed using `persp3d(..., texture = ...)`:
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2}
rglwidget(globe)
```

## Transparency

- Specifying a value of `0 < alpha < 1` makes objects partially
transparent.
```{r echo=2:3}
rgl.close()
spheres3d(xyz, col = rainbow(100), radius = 0.3)
planes3d(1, 2, 3, 4, alpha = 0.4) # The plane x + 2y + 3z + 4 = 0
par3d(zoom = 0.7)
rglwidget()
```

## Clipping planes

- Clipping planes are planes such that only the parts of objects
on one side of the plane are displayed.
```{r echo=2:3}
rgl.close()
spheres3d(xyz, col = rainbow(100), radius = 0.3)
clipplanes3d(1, 2, 3, 4) # Display only x + 2y + 3z + 4 > 0
par3d(zoom = 0.7)
rglwidget()
```

## Subscenes

- `grid` has "viewports".  That name was already taken in `rgl`, so
we have "subscenes".
- Subscenes correspond to part of the display, and can inherit 
various aspects of the parent subscene.
- Objects exist outside of subscenes, but may be chosen to be
displayed or not in each subscene, so we can get multiple views 
of the same object, or views of different objects.
- Functions `mfrow3d()` and `layout3d()` set up multiple
subscenes in regular grids.

## Subscenes with shared mouse

```{r echo=-(1:3)}
rgl.close()
# from the MASS::fitdistr example
set.seed(123)
x <- rgamma(100, shape = 5, rate = 0.1)
fit <- MASS::fitdistr(x, dgamma, list(shape = 1, rate = 0.1), 
		      lower = 0.001)

loglik <- Vectorize(function(shape, rate) 
  sum(dgamma(x, shape = shape, rate = rate, log = TRUE)))

xlim <- fit$estimate[1] + 4*fit$sd[1]*c(-1, 1)
ylim <- fit$estimate[2] + 4*fit$sd[2]*c(-1, 1)
zlim <- fit$loglik + c(-qchisq(0.99, 2)/2, 0)

mfrow3d(1, 2, sharedMouse = TRUE)
persp3d(loglik, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, n = 30)
next3d()
persp3d(loglik, xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim, zlim = zlim, n = 30)
```

## Subscene output

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5}
rglwidget()
```
  
## Model of Earth

Set up model of Earth.  Use `persp3d()` for the surface, `spheres3d()`
for inner structure.

```{r echo = FALSE}
rgl.close()
```
```{r setupearth, eval=FALSE}
```

## Set up overlapping subscenes

```{r setupclipping, echo=1:15, eval=FALSE}
```

## Show it

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
rglwidget(globe)
```

# Putting it on the web

## `rmarkdown`

- This talk uses the `rmarkdown` package: source is a mixture of
R code and Markdown.
- The `knitr` package runs the R code and inserts it into an
intermediate copy of the text, then `rmarkdown` runs Pandoc to
translate it into HTML.
- You can choose to produce PDF files from Markdown source, but
the `rgl` inserts require HTML, because PDF currently 
does not support WebGL.

## `htmlwidgets`

- Since this summer, `rgl` has used `htmlwidgets`.
- `htmlwidgets` gives a standard framework for Javascript libraries to display
in `rmarkdown` documents, `Shiny` apps, the RStudio IDE,
or any browser.
```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(-79.3889, 43.6554, zoom = 10)
```

## `rglwidget`

The WebGL code is mainly in the `rglwidget` package.
To use it, create an `rgl` plot in the usual way, and call
`rglwidget()` to insert it into the document.

    ```{r}`r ''`  
    plot3d(xyz, type = "s", col = "red")  
    rglwidget()  
    ```
Alternatively, use option `webGL = TRUE` in the chunk header:

    ```{r webGL = TRUE}`r ''`  
    plot3d(xyz, type = "s", col = "red")  
    ```
    
## What's the difference?

- `rglwidget()` needs to print to work. It will display even
without a document.
- `webGL = TRUE` needs `knitr`. It works even with `results = "hide"`.
- `rglwidget()` (currently) needs `library(rglwidget)`.  
- `webGL = TRUE` needs you to call `setupKnitr()` first.
- `webGL = TRUE` supports chunk option `rgl.newwindow = TRUE` to open a new `rgl` window.
- `rglwidget()` works better with some interactive features (see below).

I recommend the `rglwidget()` approach for new documents.

## Interactive features

- Some graphs need more interaction than just rotation.
```{r sealsetup,echo=FALSE,fig.height=4}
df   <- read.csv("seal.csv")
time <- seq_len(nrow(df)) - 1
xyz  <- cbind(df[,6],df[,7],-df[,3])
okay <- complete.cases(xyz)
xyz  <-xyz[okay,]
time <- time[okay]

lineid <-plot3d(xyz, xlab="Longitude", ylab="Latitude", zlab="Depth",
		type="l", col = c("black", "black"))["data"]
aspect3d(5,5,1)
sphereid <- spheres3d(xyz[1, , drop=FALSE], radius = 3, col = "red")
show2d(filename="sable.png", z=0, alpha=0.7)
par3d(zoom = 0.6)
rglwidget(elementId = "seal")
```
```{r playwidget, echo=FALSE}
rxyz <- round(xyz, 2)
playwidget("seal", list(ageControl(objids = lineid, births = time, 
                              ages   = c(0, 0, 1800),
                              colors = c("gray", "red", "gray")),
                   ageControl(objids = sphereid, births = 0, 
                   	      ages = time, vertices = xyz)), 
                   labels = paste(df[okay,2],-rxyz[,1],"W", 
                                  rxyz[,2],"N", rxyz[,3]),
                   start = min(time), stop = max(time), rate = 1000)
```

## Widgets, controls, setters...

- This is still in flux.  I'll only describe the newer implementation.
- Several functions act like `rglwidget()` and run Javascript: 
    - `playwidget()` creates a slider and buttons for animations.
    - `subsetControl()` selects different subsets of `rgl` objects depending on a value.
    - `vertexControl()`, `ageControl()` and `propertyControl()` modify
properties of `rgl` objects (colour, position, etc).
- The "widgets" are visible, the "controls" are not.  Controls are
intended to be modified by `playwidget()` or a Shiny input.
In turn they modify an `rglwidget()`.
- The previous system used `webGL = TRUE` and "setters"; they are not compatible.

## Putting together the seal plot

```{r sealsetup, eval=FALSE}
```

## `ageControl()`

- The abstraction in `ageControl()` is that each element of an `rgl` 
object was created (or born) at a different time.  The slider sets
the current clock time, so each element has a different age.  You set
properties based on the age.
```{r playwidget, eval=FALSE}
```
- The `playwidget()` sets the value of each `ageControl()`.

## subsetControl

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
rgl.close()
load("trisk.RData")
library(mapmisc)
df <- as.data.frame(trisk, xy=TRUE)
x <- matrix(df$x, 23, 40, byrow=TRUE)
y <- matrix(df$y, 23, 40, byrow=TRUE)
t <- matrix(seq(1, 0, len=23), 23, 40)
s <- matrix(seq(0, 1, len=40), 23, 40, byrow=TRUE)
yrs <- paste0("y", 1990:2013)
ids <- integer(length(yrs)); r <- c()
for (i in seq_along(yrs)) {
  z <- matrix(df[[yrs[i]]], 23, 40, byrow=TRUE)
  r <- range(c(r, z))
  ids[i] <- surface3d(x,y,z,  texture="toronto2.png", 
    texture_s=s, texture_t=t, col="white", specular="black")
}
par3d(zoom=0.4); aspect3d(80,46,12)
rglwidget(elementId = "Toronto")
```
```{r}
playwidget("Toronto", subsetControl(subsets = as.list(ids)),
           labels = 1990:2013, stop = length(yrs) - 1, rate = 5,
           components = c("Play", "Slider", "Label"))
```

## vertexControl

```{r echo=FALSE}
planeid <- planes3d(0,0,1,0, alpha=0.5, col="white")
rglwidget(elementId = "Toronto2")
playwidget("Toronto2", subsetControl(subsets = as.list(ids)),
           labels = 1990:2013, stop = length(yrs) - 1, rate = 5,
           components = c("Play", "Slider", "Label"))
```
```{r}
playwidget("Toronto2", vertexControl(values = matrix(r, 2, 6),
	   vertices = 1:6, attributes = "z", objid = planeid, param = r),
	   start = r[1], stop = r[2], step = 0.1, precision = 2,
	   components = c("Play", "Slider", "Label"))
```				     

## Shiny

- `shiny` is a package for interactive web pages.  R runs
on a server; the web page sends messages to the server, which
modifies the displayed material.
- The `rglwidget()` code works with `shiny`.  The round-trip
time for the message and response is a little slow.
- An example is in the `rglwidget` package; I'll show it in tomorrow's talk...

	
# Conclusion

## What's next?

- I still have a number of things on my to-do list before 
I'll think of `rgl` and `rglwidget` as finished, but they are 
definitely working now for web displays.
- I really appreciate it when people try it out, and make
suggestions, or ask for features that aren't there.
- Have fun!
